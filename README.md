# LazyLoading (test)

Small pet project for web development! In this project, I utilize lazy loading to efficiently load data from a given API using TypeScript.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of lazy loading techniques to optimize data retrieval from an API in a web development context.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: We used TypeScript for its strong typing and object-oriented features, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.
- **Web Development Tools**: Various web development tools were utilized for building and deploying the project, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript libraries/frameworks as needed.

## Implementation

- **Lazy Loading**: We implemented lazy loading techniques to load data from the given API dynamically as needed, improving page load times and user experience.
- **API Integration**: We integrated the provided API into our project to retrieve the required data for display on the web application.
- **User Interface**: A simple user interface was created using HTML and CSS to showcase the loaded data effectively.

## Installation and Setup

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
3. Install TypeScript globally using `npm install -g typescript`.
4. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using `npm install`.
5. Build the TypeScript files using `tsc`.
6. Start the development server and launch the application.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you can access the web application in your browser. The data from the API will be loaded lazily as you interact with the application, providing a smooth and efficient user experience.
